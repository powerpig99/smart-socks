## Working with Claude

Jing has a Claude session tracking this project. To get Claude's help:

1. **Upload the relevant file(s)** to the chat
2. **Give brief context** ("this is our latest sensor data" or "current circuit diagram")
3. **Ask your question**

Claude can help with: code, data analysis, document drafts, troubleshooting, ML pipeline.
