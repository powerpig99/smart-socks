## Scoring Instructions

### Standard SUS Score (Questions 1-10)

1. For odd-numbered questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9): **Subtract 1** from the user response
2. For even-numbered questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10): **Subtract the user response from 5**
3. **Add all converted scores** and **multiply by 2.5**

**SUS Score Formula:**
```
SUS Score = 2.5 × [(Q1-1) + (5-Q2) + (Q3-1) + (5-Q4) + (Q5-1) + 
                     (5-Q6) + (Q7-1) + (5-Q8) + (Q9-1) + (5-Q10)]
```

### Calculation Table

| Question | Raw Score | Converted Score |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | _____ | _____ (score - 1) |
| 2 | _____ | _____ (5 - score) |

| 4 | _____ | _____ (5 - score) |
| 5 | _____ | _____ (score - 1) |
| 6 | _____ | _____ (5 - score) |
| 7 | _____ | _____ (score - 1) |
| 8 | _____ | _____ (5 - score) |
| 9 | _____ | _____ (score - 1) |
| 10 | _____ | _____ (5 - score) |
| **Total** | | _____ |

**SUS Score:** _______ / 100
